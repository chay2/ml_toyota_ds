Data preprocessing is a critical foundation in machine learning, exemplified here using the Toyota dataset. This process involves seven essential stages. Firstly, we obtain the dataset in .CSV format. Secondly, key Python libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn are imported for efficient data manipulation. Subsequently, the dataset is imported, making it accessible for analysis. The identification and handling of missing data points follow. Categorical variables are encoded into numerical forms, enhancing compatibility with machine learning algorithms. The dataset is then split into training and test sets for robust model evaluation. Lastly, feature scaling ensures that numerical attributes have consistent scales. These steps collectively underscore the significance of data preprocessing in machine learning, with a practical application using the Toyota dataset.
